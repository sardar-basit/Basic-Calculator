üßÆ Basic Web Calculator
A fully functional, responsive calculator built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation and basic arithmetic logic.

üåü Features
Four Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Functionality: Reset button (C) to clear the display.

Decimal Support: Allows for floating-point arithmetic.

Responsive Design: Styled to look clean and work well on both desktop and mobile screens.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project is a classic "vanilla" front-end application, meaning it uses no external frameworks or libraries.

HTML (calculator.html): Structures the calculator interface (display, buttons, layout).

CSS (calculator.css): Provides the visual design, layout, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (calculator.js): Contains the core logic for handling button clicks, managing state, and performing calculations.

üöÄ Getting Started
Since this is a simple static website, running the calculator is easy.

Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser installed on your computer.

Installation & Execution
Clone the repository (or, in your case, you've already pushed it!):

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/basic-calculator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/basic-calculator.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd basic-calculator

Open the file calculator.html directly in your web browser (e.g., double-click the file in your file explorer).

The calculator interface will load, and you can begin using it immediately!
